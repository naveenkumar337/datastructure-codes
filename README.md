with execution of code

##### Stack: 
            A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements.
A stack is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle.
In the pushdown stacks only two operations are allowed: push the item into the stack, and pop the item out of the stack.
A stack is a limited access data structure - elements can be added and removed from the stack only at the top. 
push adds an item to the top of the stack, pop removes the item from the top. A helpful analogy is to think of a stack of books;
you can remove only the top book, also you can add a new book on the top.


##### PUSH:it is used for add or insert data to the stack.
##### POP: it is used for delete or retrive data to the stack.
##### PEEK: it display the top data in the stack.
##### TRAVARSE: is display the data in stack.
